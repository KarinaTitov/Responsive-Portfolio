            <p>Hi! It's not a secret, that's my first web page i ever made. You probably thinking, how i came up with
                idea to
                learn coding. I can tell you long story short.
                My name is Karina, i'm 24 years old, married and have 2 wonderfull children ( 3 year old and newborn).
                Seems
                like i have everything i need to live a normal life.
                But i want to tell you something, to live just normal life is not for me! </p>
            <p>Since childhood i had a
                dream to travel all around the world and to see every single country on this earth.
                So after being a stay-at-home mom for 3 years i decided that i have to do something about my life
                immediately!
                So i've been doing research for almost half a year to find
                something i would really want to do.</p><br />
            <p>>And finally one day i've heard about the profession of web
                developer. That sounded very interesting for me. So i decided to dive a bit deeper
                in it. Decided to try, found couple free programs. And I LOVED IT! Today i study part time in University
                of
                Texas bootcamp, doing my best to learn as much as possible
                and make my dream come true!
